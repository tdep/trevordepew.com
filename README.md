## Description
This is the 4th iteration of my personal website and hopefully the most comprehensive. The 3 previous versions can be found here:
- [`Version 3 Client`](https://github.com/tdep/tdep-tadlab-client)
- [`Version 3 API`](https://github.com/tdep/tdep-tadlab-api)
- [`Version 2`](https://github.com/tdep/portfolio-site-v2)
- [`Version 1`](https://github.com/tdep/trevor-depew-portfolio)

Technically, there are a few other repos floating around with other experiments, but we'll just ignore them :D

## Goal
The goal of this version is to combine the 3 different websites I already own:
- `https://www.trevordepew.com`
- `https://tadepewmusic.com`
- `https://tdepewmusic.wixsite.com/tdepewmusic`

Cause who needs that many URLS to remember?

In addition, this website will serve as the base for the oodles of programming experiments and projects I want to share
with the world such as the [`Sequinzer6001-2a`](https://github.com/tdep/Sequinzer-6001-2a), the [`TadLab`](https://github.com/tdep/tadlab),
and other fun things like games and fractals.
